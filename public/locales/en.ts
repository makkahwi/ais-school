      Para1:
        "In 2017, most international families around Klang Valley did try to register their children to public schools in Malaysia, but more than 90% of them did not manage to. So they headed to private schools, trying to find an affordable school where their children would have good education at appropriate costs, and they failed to find such schools.",
      Para2:
        "So of that, many of these families did not register their kids to any school since their arrival to Malaysia and kept their kids home. Others, those who did register their kids to schools, were in bad financial situations due to the high charges, beside the fact that most of those parents are university students. In some cases, they were not satisfied with the education level and the culture those schools promoted.",
      Para3:
        "At that time, a group of those parents gathered to discuss a solutions, and they decided that the only way is to form the solution by their-selves. So they planed, raised some money, find suitable building and established the school to pass all mentioned obstacles, and the school was operating by October 2018. So, there are no commercial purposes behind the school establishment, it solely goal is to provide a solution for a dilemma many international families around Kalng Valley did have.",
